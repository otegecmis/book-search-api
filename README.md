## Book Search API [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/otegecmis/book-search-api/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

This API, built with `Express.js` under `Node.js`, is designed for searching books. It uses `Redis` for `authentication blacklisting` and `PostgreSQL` with Prisma for data storage. The project follows the `MVC + Service + Repository` pattern for an organized structure. Documentation is provided via `Swagger` and `JSDoc`. Testing is conducted using `Jest` and `SuperTest`. Automated releases and version control are facilitated with `Semantic Release` and `GitHub Actions`.
